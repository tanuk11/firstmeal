            <p>If your aim is to lose weight in a gradual
                , healthy manner then this diet would meet
                 your requirements. The meals are well balanced
                  and consist of complex carbohydrates, 
                  lean protein, healthy fats and generous
                   portions of fruits and vegetables which
                    add all the essential vitamins, 
                minerals and fibre to your diet.</p>

                <p>Disclaimer: This isn’t going to be any 
                    type of a crash diet which will give you 
                    magical results; we’ll aim for 2-4kgs per
                     month and all your meals will be designed by
                      our nutritionists who focus not only on seeing 
                      results but also on ensuring that there’s 
                    no compromise on your mental and physical health.</p>
